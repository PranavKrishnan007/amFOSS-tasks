## My Approach To Tasks

I am noob at coding, One of the main problems I faced in pretty much every task was with the installation phase as there is always an error regarding 'access'/'permission' which at many time I had to go fetch individual folders and give permission which was very frustrating.ðŸ˜“

For pretty much all the tasks I first went through all the attached references, then searched for more references till I completed the task.

I came across an awesome quote: 'There are always different ways to code something .... most of CS is just finding the most efficient and most fastest way to get the job done!'

## About ME 

hello, I'm Pranav, I have some experience in coding but not too much ðŸ˜“ ... I've been a "computer and information technology prefect" in my school for 2 years like in class 8th or something when they used to teach us HTML and I was relatively better than my peers at it lol, but yeah I took CS in class 12th so I do have some base in CS. 

I love reading about new tech stuff both hardware and software ... Even if I don't necessarily understand everything I generally give it a read regardless ðŸ˜¹

I'm curious in nature, I generally waste a lot of time just searching about random useless info at times(which I subjectively find interesting). Thats why I kinda loved doing the tasks because they introduced me to stuff which I didn't know off or how to do. (+ the intro to the world of linux) âœ¨
