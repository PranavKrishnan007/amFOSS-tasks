# Introspection

## 1. Why must we choose you?
I wish to learn and explore the development side of CS and eventually want to contribute to open-source and make cool projects 🤩 . And would contribute to the club activities to the best of my ability ✌🏾✌🏾
> I wasn't able to contribute to tasks for around 12 days because of personal reasons and hacktoberfest ( although the latter was a personal choice so not sure if that excuse works 😅 )
> But I've tried my best to complete the tasks 😺

## 2. What is your plan for next 6 months?
If possible I would first like to explore for a month try out different stuff ... but I do have an inclination towards web-dev because of a tiny base I have with html.
so if I find a field I like I would like to invest the next 6 months towards developing my skill in that field.

## 3. How would you contribute back to the club?
like I said I'm a noob as of now so first I would like to learn, but eventually yeah would love to contribute the open-source community, participate in club activities. 
And contribute to any existing tasks/objectives that the club has if possible 👌🏽

## 4. Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
The tasks were ranging from what I would say easy to byebye sleep 😂 but yeah the tough ones provided good opportunity to learn new things.
