# Installing ~~UBUNTU~~

I skipped this step because I have macOS  installed in my laptop 😁

**Although from this task I got curious about how to dual booting and I learned how to partition the hard disk on mac using disk utility, I would like to try and boot ubuntu on my mac after like the mid term exams ✌🏾
