# CS50 😍

Honestly this is the best course I've ever attended ... I loved the way they explain things, I unfortunately had to do this task twice 😭 🤧

I lost the password to my gmail which I used to login tbh that was like a very old gmail which I made for registering for some game 😅
and I didn't submit the code so I just did the it again 

I've completed till `lecture 2` with 1 problem remaining in pset2, If I'm able to complete it before 20th, I would push it 👌🏽

> I've submitted all the codes which I've given here ... all got accepted without errors ✌🏾
