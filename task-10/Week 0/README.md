# Pset 0 (Scratch)

[This](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/564846673/) is the link to my scratch project. âœ¨


I took this task as a personal challenge ðŸ˜¹ I remember my friends doing scratch (as kids) and I remember that I always wanted to do it but couldn't ... so I poured my heart out trying to do this task lol, it accomplished nothing just took a extra time for me to complete the pset ðŸ˜‚ ... hope you like it! ðŸ˜‰
