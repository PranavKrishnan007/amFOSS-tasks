# Make the BLOCK ðŸ§±

I'm currently reading and understanding the concept of blockchain, ledgers, hashing .... I'm taking reference from the reference material provided + some vid and text reference of my own .... I've uploaded the trial block I made using the youtube tutorial. I don't really know java but this was mainly to follow along so I understood how it works ðŸ˜º
