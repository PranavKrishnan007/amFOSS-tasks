# Let Me C

well this task took me longer than I expected, it was okayish task but if a reference of how the game was supposed to played once all the bugs was solved would have
been great(like just the output) ðŸ˜Œ

As of now I've fixed the syntax errors, the forever loops, and the missing ; and some logical errors here and there ðŸ˜¸
