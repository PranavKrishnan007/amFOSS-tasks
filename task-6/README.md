this task was so much fun to do like every time I made changes to the code and gave it a hot reload and the UI would change ðŸ˜³

<p align="center"><img src="./task-6.gif" alt="sample-ui" width="250" height="500"/></a></p>

sooo I accidentally deleted all my flutter files without uploading, I actually thought that we only had to upload the gif of the final product and actually by the time I was done with the task my laptop had started to lag and was getting stuck,heating up ðŸ˜¥ so I had to free up some storage ...I don't know why but when rom on my laptop goes below 40 gb it just starts stuttering the Os animations would lag and all. So I ended up deleting the files but I've added all the steps which I followed in `explanation.md`. sorry.
