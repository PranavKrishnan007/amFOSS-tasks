This task was easy once the installation part was done, but I pretty much died during the installation part ðŸ˜­. I had a bunch of trouble installing the gems, even in the flutter task I got by with Homebrew but for this we had to install it through 
gem .... but a huge thank you to my mentors **(Athira didi and kavya)** who helped me out with errors.
